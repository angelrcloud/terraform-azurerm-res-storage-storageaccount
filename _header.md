# terraform-azurerm-avm-res-storage-storageaccount

This is a Storage Account repo in the style of Azure Verified Modules (AVM), it is an 'unofficial' example.

This will be deprecated once the upstream resource from Microsoft is available, in the interim, PRs and feedback that align to the AVM specifications are welcome.

GitHub Actions does an end to end deployment into Azure for each example, along with resource tidy up.  The following [examples](./examples) are available:

- the default parameters
- a storage account & container, deployed with access keys disabled
- private endpoints (blob & table)

To find official modules, please visit: <https://aka.ms/AVM>.
