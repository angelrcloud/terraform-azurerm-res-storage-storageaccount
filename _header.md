# Terraform AzureRM - Storage Account

This is a Storage Account repo ***in the style of*** Azure Verified Modules (AVM).

To find official modules, please visit: <https://aka.ms/AVM>.

This will be deprecated once the upstream resource from Microsoft is available, in the interim, PRs and feedback that align to the AVM specifications are welcome.

GitHub Actions does an end to end deployment into Azure for each of the [examples](./examples), along with resource tidy up.

> [!WARNING]
> Major version Zero (0.y.z) is for initial development. Anything MAY change at any time. A module SHOULD NOT be considered stable till at least it is major version one (1.0.0) or greater. Changes will always be via new versions being published and no changes will be made to existing published versions. For more details please go to <https://semver.org/>
